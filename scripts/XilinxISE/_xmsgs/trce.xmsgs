<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="2752" delta="old" >To get complete path coverage, use the unconstrained paths option. All paths that are not constrained will be reported in the unconstrained paths section(s) of the report.</msg>

<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="3339" delta="old" >The clock-to-out numbers in this timing report are based on a 50 Ohm transmission line loading model.  For the details of this model, and for more information on accounting for different loading conditions, please see the device datasheet.</msg>

<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="3390" delta="old" >This architecture does not support a default System Jitter value, please add SYSTEM_JITTER constraint to the UCF to modify the Clock Uncertainty calculation.</msg>

<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="3389" delta="old" >This architecture does not support &apos;Discrete Jitter&apos; and &apos;Phase Error&apos; calculations, these terms will be zero in the Clock Uncertainty calculation.  Please make appropriate modification to SYSTEM_JITTER to account for the unsupported Discrete Jitter and Phase Error.</msg>
